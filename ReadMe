Within hospitals a critical metric is the amount of time a patient spends there before being discharged.  
This metric, known in the healthcare industry as boarding time, tells literally how long a patient is in the hospital before being released.  
What our group has decided to do is look at these boarding times in hospitals around Minnesota, from a variety of towns and cities big and small, to figure out if boarding times were comparable and how, and why, these numbers varied.

Programs used in this project included SQL Alchemy, Pandas, SQLite, and a variety of other programs.

This project was worked on by Edith Lotterman, Lauren Cadogen, Megan Blazevic, and Will Dickerson.
