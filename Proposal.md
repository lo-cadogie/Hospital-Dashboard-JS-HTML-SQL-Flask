# Project 3 | Hospital Boarding

Looking at hospital data from 2022, determine how many hours patients have boarded in hospital Emergency Departments (ED).  Since Covid (and subsequent tridemic), many patients have been sitting in the ED waiting to be admitted.  
For this project, we have looked mostly at the patients that have boarded more than 4 hours (after the decision to admit has been made). Boarding typically is for admitted patients, but many patients that are being transfered to another locaiton have boarded (example would be a patient needing a higher level of care as the speciality service is not provieded at that hospital).

## Data & Delivery
Our Project
Our data is pulled from 11 various metro hospitals from 2022. Data was pulled from a vendor; cleaned to pull out HPI information; and then read into our data view csv files.  Data sets that show patient detail; and then the daily representation of patients seen that day that boarded.

Requirements
- data components used are clearly documented
- dataselt contrains at least 100 unique records
- database is used to house the data (sql)
- powered by python flas api and includes HTML/CSS, Javascript

## Visualizations
Our Project
